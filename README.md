# ChatBot
This is a simple chatbot where you are a customer in a donut shop.

# Instructions
1. Download all files and ensure that the file structure is maintained.
2. Open a new terminal and change your current working directory to the ChatBot folder downloaded in step 1.
3. It is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment before continuing.
4. Ensure that the below python libraries are installed by running the following:
   * pip install numpy
   * pip install tflearn
   * pip install tensorflow
   *  pip install nltk
5. To start the program, run the following command:
   * python main.py

# Additional Notes
1. You can add new responses to the chatbot by using the 'teach' command (just say the word 'teach' to the bot).
2. You can change the scenario (currently donut shop) by changing the contents of the intents.json file
